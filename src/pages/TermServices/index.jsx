                <p className="mb-4">

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Fees and any other charges for the use of the Application and for any Add-ons are described on the Site. They may change from time to time. If we change them, we will give you at least 30 days’ notice. If they do change, your continued use of the Application or the Add-ons, as the case may be, after the change indicates your agreement with the new fees and charges after the effective date of the change. Any change to fees and other charges will not be applicable to the billing period in which the change occurs.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    All sales are final. Payments made are Non-Refundable.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Ownership, Copyright, and Trademarks</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    In these Terms, the content available through the Services, including all information, data, logos, marks, designs, graphics, pictures, sound files, other files, and their selection and arrangement, is called "Content". Content provided by Users, whether they are Subscribers, Members, or other Users, is called "User Content". For example, data about its Members and about its timesheet entries that a Subscriber provides to the Services is User Content of that Subscriber, data about its Members that a Member provides to the Services is User Content of that Member, and Content that a User enters into the TimeStation forum or enters as a comment on the TimeStation blog is User Content of the User.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Your Limited License of Your User Content to TimeStation</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    We do not claim any ownership interest in your User Content, but we do need the right to use your User Content to the extent necessary to operate the Site and provide the Services, now and in the future. For example, if you leave comments on the TimeStation blog or posts on the TimeStation forum, we need your license to display that User Content on the Services, and we need the right to sublicense that User Content to our other Users so that they can view that User Content.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Our Limited License of Content to You</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    TimeStation grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to access the Services and to view, copy, and print the portions of the Content available to you through the Services.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Your use of any Add-on is governed by the End User License Agreement that applies to that Add-on, and not by this Section of the Terms. That End User License Agreement is an agreement between you and the provider of that Add-on.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. Use of Interactive Areas and the Services</h2>
                <p>
                    The Services may include discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services or other forums in which you or third parties may post reviews or other content, messages, materials or other items on the Services ("Interactive Areas"). If TimeStation provides such Interactive Areas, you are solely responsible for your use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk. User Content submitted to any public area of the Services will be considered non-confidential. You agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services any of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any message, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, graphics, code or other material that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable;</li>
                    <li>Content that would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law;</li>
                    <li>Content that may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party;</li>
                    <li>Content that impersonates any person or entity or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity;</li>
                    <li>Unsolicited promotions, political campaigning, advertising or solicitations;</li>
                    <li>Private information of any third party, including, without limitation, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and credit card numbers, unless that third party has expressly consented to such use;</li>
                    <li>Viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files;</li>
                    <li>Content that is unrelated to the topic of the Interactive Area(s) in which such Content is posted;</li>
                    <li>Content that, in the sole judgment of TimeStation, is objectionable or which restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Interactive Areas or the Services, or which may expose TimeStation or its affiliates or its users to any harm or liability of any type.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Finally, TimeStation has a "zero-tolerance" policy towards SPAM: you may not use the Interactive Areas or the Services generally to send commercial or other messages to any third-party if those messages are not solicited, authorized or welcomed by the third-party, and in your use of the Services you must comply with all applicable laws, including laws that apply in any jurisdiction to SPAM and marketing practices, and with any applicable marketing association guidelines on ethical marketing practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any use of the Interactive Areas or other portions of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates these Terms and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8. Providing a Reliable and Secure Service</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have spent any time reviewing the Services, you will hopefully have noticed that we take reliability and security seriously. We put a great deal of effort into ensuring that our service operates all the time, and that it is a secure environment for your data. We use what we believe to be "best-of-class" hosting services and security technologies and services that we believe provide you with a secure and safe environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, to safeguard credit card information, TimeStation doesn't store your credit card numbers. Credit card numbers are sent in an encrypted fashion to credit card processors that adhere to industry standard PCI compliant procedures to encrypt, secure and store credit card information. Additionally, TimeStation uses restrictive firewalls to protect stored data and uses 128 bit SSL certificates to encrypt data transferred between you and the Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, no system is perfectly secure or reliable, the Internet is an inherently insecure medium, and the reliability of hosting services, Internet intermediaries, your Internet service provider, and other service providers cannot be assured. When you use TimeStation, you accept these risks, and the responsibility for choosing to use a technology that does not provide perfect security or reliability. In particular, Subscribers who enable auto-billing and choose to store their credit card information accept these risks to the security of that credit card information. When storing credit card information using the TimeStation recurring billing module, Subscribers acknowledge that they are aware of, and accept as satisfactory, TimeStation's credit card protection procedures. Ultimately, credit card data is provided by Subscribers, and they are responsible for its protection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, TimeStation provides the TimeStation Mobile Application to facilitate the use of the Services with mobile devices. If a third party is authorized through your TimeStation account to have access to your User Content through the TimeStation Mobile Application, we cannot control and are not responsible or liable for the third party’s use of your User Content.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9. No Responsibility for Third-Party Material</h2>
                <p>
                    The Site may contain links to third-party Web sites ("Third-Party Sites") and third-party content ("Third-Party Content") as a service to those interested in this information, including Add-ons, payment processors and other payment intermediaries that you may use in connection with your use of the Services. You use links to Third-Party Sites and any Third-Party Content or service provided there, at your own risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TimeStation makes no claim or representation regarding Third-Party Content or Third-Party Sites, and provides them or links to them only as a convenience. Inclusion in the Services of a link to a Third-Party Site or Third-Party Content does not imply TimeStation's endorsement, adoption or sponsorship of, or affiliation with, such Third-Party Site or Third-Party Content. TimeStation accepts no responsibility for reviewing changes or updates to, or the quality, content, policies, nature or reliability of, Third-Party Content, Third-Party Sites, or Web sites linking to the Services. When you leave the Services, our terms and policies no longer govern. You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Site, and should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The provider of each Add-on is solely responsible for that Add-on, the content therein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, any training, support or maintenance for the Add-on, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Add-on or your use of that Add-on.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10. Advertisements and Promotions</h2>
                <p>
                    TimeStation may run advertisements and promotions from third parties on the Services. Your business dealings or correspondence with, or participation in promotions of, advertisers other than TimeStation, and any terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such third party. TimeStation is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of third-party advertisers on the Services.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>
                    The Site, the Content, the Add-ons and the Services are provided to you on an "as is" basis without warranties from TimeStation of any kind, either express or implied. TimeStation expressly disclaims all other warranties, express or implied, including without limitation implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. TimeStation does not represent or warrant that Site, the Content, the Add-ons or the Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While TimeStation attempts to make your access to and use of the Services safe, TimeStation does not represent or warrant that the Site, the Content, the Add-ons or the Services are free of viruses or other harmful components.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12. Limitation of Liability; Indemnity</h2>
                <p>
                    You waive and shall not assert any claims or allegations of any nature whatsoever against TimeStation, its affiliates or subsidiaries, their sponsors, contractors, advertisers, vendors or other partners, any of their successors or assigns, or any of their respective officers, directors, agents or employees (collectively, the "Released Parties") arising out of or in any way relating to your use of the Site, the Content, the Add-ons or the Services, including, without limitation, any claims or allegations relating to infringement of proprietary rights, or allegations that any Released Party has or should indemnify, defend or hold harmless you or any third party from any claim or allegation arising from your use or other exploitation of the Site, the Content, the Add-ons or the Services.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">13. Communications</h2>
                <p>
                    TimeStation may communicate with you by e-mail, regular mail or by posting notices on the Site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that TimeStation provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. You must check the Site periodically for notices. Any information you submit to the Site or post in any public area may be used by TimeStation without compensation to you.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">14. Applicable Law and Venue</h2>
                <p>
                    The Services are controlled by TimeStation and operated by it from its offices in Fort Lee, New Jersey. You and TimeStation both benefit from establishing a predictable legal environment in regard to the Services. Therefore, you and TimeStation explicitly agree that all disputes, claims or other matters arising from or relating to your use of the Site, the Content, the Add-ons or the Services will be governed by the laws of the state of New Jersey and the federal laws of United States applicable therein. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except where prohibited by applicable law, any claim, dispute or controversy (whether in contract or tort, pursuant to statute or regulation, or otherwise, and whether preexisting, present or future) involving TimeStation and arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms; (b) the Site, the Content, the Add-ons or the Services; (c) oral or written statements, advertisements or promotions relating to these Terms or to the Site, the Content, the Add-ons or the Services; or (d) the relationships that result from these Terms or the Site, the Content, the Add-ons or the Services (collectively, a "Claim"), will be referred to and determined by a sole arbitrator (to the exclusion of the courts). Except where prohibited by applicable law, you waive any right you may have to commence or participate in any class action against TimeStation related to any Claim and, where applicable, you also agree to opt out of any class proceedings against TimeStation. If you have a Claim, you should give written notice to arbitrate at the address specified below. If we have a Claim, we will give you notice to arbitrate at your address provided in your Registration Data. Arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator pursuant to the commercial arbitration laws and rules in effect on the date of the notice in the state of New Jersey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the extent arbitration as described in the immediately preceding paragraph is prohibited by applicable law, you agree that all Claims will be heard and resolved in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Fort Lee, New Jersey. You consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts over you, stipulate to the fairness and convenience of proceeding in such courts, and covenant not to assert any objection to proceeding in such courts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you choose to access the Services from locations other than Fort Lee, New Jersey, you will be responsible for compliance with all local laws of such other jurisdiction and you agree to indemnify TimeStation and the other Released Parties for your failure to comply with any such laws.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">15. Termination/Modification of License and Site Offerings</h2>
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, TimeStation reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, without any notice or liability to you, to (a) terminate your license to use the Services, or any portion thereof (including any use of any Add-on) and the rights of any third party to which you have granted access to your User Content through the TimeStation Mobile Application; (b) block or prevent your future access to and use of all or any portion of the Services or Content (including any use of any Add-on) and the rights of any third party to which you have granted access to your User Content through the TimeStation Mobile Application; (c) change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Services or Content; and (d) impose limits on the Services or Content.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">16. Inactive Accounts; Termination of Agreement</h2>
                <p>
                    If your account is inactive for at least three months, we may deactivate your account. Deactivated accounts are not deleted – they are placed in storage and can be restored. We will notify you by email if we decide to deactivate your account. If you know in advance that your account will be inactive at some time and don’t want us to deactivate it, let us know in advance at support@MyTimeStation.com. If after your account has been deactivated it stays inactive and we don’t hear from you, we may terminate it at any time and without notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You and TimeStation may terminate your use of the Services including your agreement to these Terms at any time. If you terminate your use of the Services you must pay the fees applicable for the balance of the then current billing period (if your billing period is monthly, we will prorate your account to the nearest month-end after termination) including for any Add-ons you may be using. When your TimeStation account is terminated, your User Content will, shortly thereafter, not appear on the Services, except for User Content submitted to public areas of the Site such as the blog, forum, or product reviews, which may remain on the Site after termination. We may also retain an archival copy of your User Content after termination, and you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to maintain such archival copy for our internal business purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If these Terms expire or terminate for any reason, Sections 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 17, and any representation or warranty you make in these Terms, shall survive indefinitely.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">17. Miscellaneous</h2>
                <p>
                    If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. TimeStation may assign any or all of its rights hereunder to any party without your consent. You are not permitted to assign any of your rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of TimeStation, and any such attempted assignment will be void and unenforceable. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and TimeStation regarding your use of the Site, the Content, the Add-ons and the Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications whether electronic, oral or written between you and TimeStation regarding your use of them. The parties confirm that it is their wish that these Terms, as well as any other documents relating to this Terms, including notices, have been and shall be drawn up in the English language only.
                </p>
